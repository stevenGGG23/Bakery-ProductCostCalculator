# Bakery-ProductCostCalculator 

This project is a Bakery Product Cost Calculator that computes the costs of various bakery items based on ingredient amounts and their respective unit prices. Using input files (recipes.dat and products.dat), the program reads the ingredient quantities and prices, calculates the total price for each product, and outputs a neatly formatted table displaying the results. Additionally, it identifies the most expensive product, providing insights into pricing for bakery management.

Reads ingredient data and unit prices from external files.
Calculates total costs for up to 24 products, each with up to 30 ingredients.
Outputs a formatted table for easy readability.
